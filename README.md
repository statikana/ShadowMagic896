### Hey :wave:, I'm ShadowMagic896

I like to make whatever I'm motivated to do.
Not open for employment.

## Stuff About Moi
I've been programming since August, 2021. I started out with Python, and eventually learned other langages like C#, Java, and Rust. As of writing, most projects that I create are written in pure python but I would like to expand my knowledge to other areas, especially lower-level languages.

I like making bots for Discord, DM me on it if you want one.

I prefer to work alone for most projects, feel free to PR my stuff though.

All of my code is under the MIT license unless specifically noted otherwise.
